## Abstract

We investigate the sources, scope, and implications of landowner market power.
We show how monopolistic landownership creates contemporary scarcity and truncates future redevelopment relative to social optimum.
We discuss how popular subsidies for redevelopment, zoning regulations, and ownership concentration restrictions in- teract with monopoly power.
Using new building-level data from New York City, we quantify the scope and impact of monopoly power.
A 10% increase in ownership concentration in a Census tract is correlated with a 1% increase in rent.
Market power is a substantial economic force: markups account for at least a fifth of rents in the city.

<!-- ## Data and code

The project is reproducible with R code [available at GitHub](https://github.com/andrewheiss/who-cares-about-crackdown). Follow [the instructions there](https://github.com/andrewheiss/who-cares-about-crackdown#how-to-download-and-replicate) to install all supporting files and R packages.

This project includes the following data files:

- [**`data/raw_data/final_data.rds`**](https://osf.io/n2hwm/): Original results from the Qualtrics survey. This is [hosted at OSF](https://osf.io/n2hwm/) because of its size. Running `targets::tar_make(survey_results_file)` will download the `.rds` file from OSF and place it in `data/raw_data`. The [code for cleaning and processing this data is part of a separate project, "Why Donors Donate"](https://github.com/andrewheiss/why-donors-donate).
- [**`data/derived_data/survey_results.csv`**](https://github.com/andrewheiss/who-cares-about-crackdown/blob/master/data/derived_data/survey_results.csv): CSV version of the survey data.
- [**`data/derived_data/survey_results.yaml`**](https://github.com/andrewheiss/who-cares-about-crackdown/blob/master/data/derived_data/survey_results.yaml): [YAML metadata](https://csvy.org/) describing the syntax of the survey data.
- [**`data/raw_data/posterior_draws/public_political_social_charity_demo.rds`**](https://osf.io/msaz8/): Gamma (Γ) coefficients from our multilevel Bayesian model. This is [hosted at OSF](https://osf.io/msaz8/) because of its size. Running `targets::tar_make(gamma_draws_file)` will download the `.rds` file from OSF and place it in `data/raw_data/posterior_draws`. The [code for running this model is part of a separate project, "Why Donors Donate"](https://github.com/andrewheiss/why-donors-donate).
- [**`data/raw_data/Market Simulator Version 01.xlsx`**](https://github.com/andrewheiss/who-cares-about-crackdown/blob/master/data/raw_data/Market%20Simulator%20Version%2001.xlsx): An interactive Excel version of the market simulator to help demonstrate the intuition behind all the moving parts of the simulation.

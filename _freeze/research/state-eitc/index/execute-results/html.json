Yet no systematic evaluation of these supplements exists. I use state border policy variation to identify state supplements effects. I first document that subsidy rates are greater when a stateâ€™s neighbor already has a supplement. Next, I assess whether supplements affect county level EITC take-up, migration, commuting, employment, and earnings. Estimates are sensitive to the estimation design and sample used. While supplements increase benefits to low-income workers, results fail to provide robust evidence of increased economic activity.\n\n**Note: the empirics on this paper are not finalized and should not be cited.**\n\n## Graph from the paper\n\n### Timing and intensity of use\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](timing.png){width=1120}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Possible policy coordination\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](coordination.png){width=1154}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## BibTeX citation\n\n```bibtex\n@techreport{watson_state_eitc:2021,\n    Author = {C.

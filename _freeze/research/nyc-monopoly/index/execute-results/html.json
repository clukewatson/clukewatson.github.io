Follow [the instructions there](https://github.com/andrewheiss/who-cares-about-crackdown#how-to-download-and-replicate) to install all supporting files and R packages.\n\nThis project includes the following data files:\n\n- [**`data/raw_data/final_data.rds`**](https://osf.io/n2hwm/): Original results from the Qualtrics survey. This is [hosted at OSF](https://osf.io/n2hwm/) because of its size. Running `targets::tar_make(survey_results_file)` will download the `.rds` file from OSF and place it in `data/raw_data`. The [code for cleaning and processing this data is part of a separate project, \"Why Donors Donate\"](https://github.com/andrewheiss/why-donors-donate).\n- [**`data/derived_data/survey_results.csv`**](https://github.com/andrewheiss/who-cares-about-crackdown/blob/master/data/derived_data/survey_results.csv): CSV version of the survey data.\n- [**`data/derived_data/survey_results.yaml`**](https://github.com/andrewheiss/who-cares-about-crackdown/blob/master/data/derived_data/survey_results.yaml): [YAML metadata](https://csvy.org/) describing the syntax of the survey data.\n- [**`data/raw_data/posterior_draws/public_political_social_charity_demo.rds`**](https://osf.io/msaz8/): Gamma (Γ) coefficients from our multilevel Bayesian model. This is [hosted at OSF](https://osf.io/msaz8/) because of its size. Running `targets::tar_make(gamma_draws_file)` will download the `.rds` file from OSF and place it in `data/raw_data/posterior_draws`. The [code for running this model is part of a separate project, \"Why Donors Donate\"](https://github.com/andrewheiss/why-donors-donate).\n- [**`data/raw_data/Market Simulator Version 01.xlsx`**](https://github.com/andrewheiss/who-cares-about-crackdown/blob/master/data/raw_data/Market%20Simulator%20Version%2001.xlsx): An interactive Excel version of the market simulator to help demonstrate the intuition behind all the moving parts of the simulation.\n -->\n\n## BibTeX citation\n\n```bibtex\n@techreport{watson_istherenttoohigh:2022,\n    Author = {Watson, C.

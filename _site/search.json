    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nWe investigate the sources, scope, and implications of landowner market power. We show how monopolistic landownership creates contemporary scarcity and truncates future redevelopment relative to social optimum. We discuss how popular subsidies for redevelopment, zoning regulations, and ownership concentration restrictions in- teract with monopoly power. Using new building-level data from New York City, we quantify the scope and impact of monopoly power. A 10% increase in ownership concentration in a Census tract is correlated with a 1% increase in rent. Market power is a substantial economic force: markups account for at least a fifth of rents in the city.\nNote: the paper is out of date with the slides due to disclosure rules by the FDIC."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Zoutman, Gavrilova, & Hopland (Econometrica, 2018) show that by knowing on ‘which side of the market’ an ‘exogenous’ tax is levied one can use a single tax instrument to estimate both a supply and a demand elasticity. This seemingly goes against the intuition that one needs two instruments for two parameters; i.e., a ‘supply’ and a ‘demand’ instrument. I show that the result is only true with partial equilibrium assumptions. Without further assumptions, tax reform induced general equilibrium price spillover effects imply that the tax rates are correlated with the unobserved structural errors. Thus, tax rates on their own are invalid instruments for at least one of the parameters. However, I show that if one can calculate a measure of spillovers, then one can still estimate the two elasticities using one tax reform, but with the spillover measure as an additional instrument."

    "text": "Author’s Notes\nI do not expect to revise this paper anytime soon. I submitted it to Economics Letters in Oct 2021, and the paper was rejected with referee reports. The turn-around was quick and I have no complaints about the process.\nI do not wish the paper to be seen as a comment on ZGH 2018; rather, a warning for others looking to follow their advice. One referee claimed that if one includes the other markets’ prices in the structural function (and as expected the first stage), then identification is possible based on results from a 1970s J.Hausman paper. While I trust that referee’s argument is sound, I have not worked this out myself. I do worry that this would not work in finite samples, but then in this case maybe the IV will not work either."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTwenty eight states spend $4 billion to supplement the federal Earned Income Tax Credit, with several justifying the tax expenditure as a pro-work incentive. Yet no systematic evaluation of these supplements exists. I use state border policy variation to identify state supplements effects. I first document that subsidy rates are greater when a state’s neighbor already has a supplement. Next, I assess whether supplements affect county level EITC take-up, migration, commuting, employment, and earnings. Estimates are sensitive to the estimation design and sample used. While supplements increase benefits to low-income workers, results fail to provide robust evidence of increased economic activity.\nNote: the empirics on this paper are not finalized and should not be cited."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe Earned Income Tax Credit is a $67 billion tax expenditure that subsidizes 20% of all workers. Yet all prior analysis uses partial equilibrium assumptions on gross wages. I derive the general equilibrium incidence of wage subsidies and quantify the importance of EITC spillovers in three ways. I calculate the GE incidence of the 1993 and 2009 EITC expansions using new elasticity estimates. I contrast the incidence of counterfactual EITC and Welfare expansions. I quantify the effect of equalizing the EITC for workers with and without children. In all cases, I find spillovers are economically meaningful."

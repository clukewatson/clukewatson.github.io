## Howdy, world!

I am Financial Economist in the [Center for Financial Research](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/index.html) at the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://www.fdic.gov). I earned my PhD in economics from [Michigan State University's College of Social Science](http://econ.msu.edu) in 2021. I earned my BA and MA in economics for [Old Dominion University's Strome College of Business](https://www.odu.edu/business).

For the FDIC, I research bank branching decisions, consumer access to banking services, and the emergence of online banking.
In addition, my corporate work includes methodological and performance evaluation of bank financial models as part of the Quantitative Risk Analysis section.
My dissertation work focused on the general equilibrium effects of the Earned Income Tax Credit and market power in urban rental markets.

On this site I maintain my [CV](cv_clw.pdf) and [research](research), as well as a [blog](blog.html).

The views and opinions expressed on this website do not reflect those of the FDIC, the United States, nor anyone else.

These are notes I wrote on Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and production function estimation as a research assistant: [TFP_guide.pdf](TFP_guide.pdf).
These notes are a mix of theory and code to estimate.
I should liberate the code from the pdf.
I think there is now a Stata or R package that does several different methods.

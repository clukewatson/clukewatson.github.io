These are notes I wrote on preference relations for first year phd micro: [notes01_preferences.pdf](notes01_preferences.pdf).
I typed the notes to learn LaTeX and pass the time waiting on getting prelim results.
I think they are pretty good.
I started a companion set for utility maximization problems, but only got through the math parts without getting to the micro.
Maybe I will try to finish it.

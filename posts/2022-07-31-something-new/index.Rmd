I saw a couple of websites and thought mine could do with an update. 
In particular, [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com) has an **amazing** website... but I don't know how to replicate it.
Thus, I am borrowing from [Mike Mahoney](https://www.mm218.dev) before *he* creates something too advanced for me to follow.
